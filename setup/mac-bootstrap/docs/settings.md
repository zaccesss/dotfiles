# Settings

macOS settings live in [defaults](../../defaults), not here. It holds three
files under `mac/`:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `tracked.txt` | The keys worth carrying from one Mac to the next, grouped by area |
| `defaults.tsv` | The values captured from a real Mac, with their types |
| `defaults.sh` | The script that captures (`--capture`) and applies them |

The bootstrap's settings stage runs the script from that folder of the dotfiles clone in
`~/dev/github/repos/dotfiles`. Keeping the data and the script together means one source of truth that
works with or without this bootstrap, alongside the Linux settings in the same folder.

## Capturing

```bash
./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh --capture-settings
```

Records this Mac's values for every tracked key into the defaults folder's
`defaults.tsv`. Keys left at the system default are not recorded. Commit the file in your own fork
afterwards, so your next Mac gets your settings rather than the published ones.

## Applying

```bash
./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh --settings-only
```

Only values that differ are written, so a Mac that already matches is not touched. The Dock, Finder
and menu bar restart only when one of their own settings changed. A path stored with `~` and the
same path spelt out count as equal.

## Accessibility settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Accessibility choices such as pointer size, contrast and the zoom shortcuts are carried over
> exactly as captured. macOS sometimes refuses writes to accessibility settings from a script. When
> it does, the run does not fail: each one is listed at the end so it can be set in System Settings,
> Accessibility.

## Settings outside the scope

Display arrangement, Wi-Fi, notifications per app, login items, privacy permissions and VoiceOver
(which exports from VoiceOver Utility) are set by hand. See the [new Mac checklist](new-mac.md).
